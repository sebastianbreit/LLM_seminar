Since Betty is a woman, it is more likely that she washed her hair more frequently than men who typically wash their hair less often. The average person washes their hair around 3-4 times per week, which would amount to approximately 12-16 times in a month.

Since Betty is a woman, it is reasonable to assume that she washes her hair multiple times in a month, possibly more than once a week. Considering the options provided, 18 or 29, 29 seems like the more likely number. This is because 18 times in a month would mean Betty washes her hair roughly every other day, which might be less common for most people.

Since Betty is a woman, it is reasonable to assume that she washes her hair regularly. However, washing one's hair 29 times in a month seems excessive, as it would mean washing it almost every day. On the other hand, washing her hair 18 times in a month seems more plausible, as it would mean washing it every other day or every two days.

Since Betty is a woman from the US, the number of times she washes her hair in a month can vary depending on personal preferences, hair type, and lifestyle. On average, people tend to wash their hair around 2-3 times per week. Assuming Betty follows this average, we can estimate the number of times she washed her hair in a month.

Considering a month has roughly four weeks, Betty would wash her hair approximately 8-12 times in a month. Therefore, the more likely number between 18 and 29 would be 18."

Since the information provided does not give any specific details about Lily's dishwasher usage, we can consider some general factors that may influence the number of times it was used. 

Considering that Lily is a woman from the US, her dishwasher usage could vary depending on factors such as household size, lifestyle, and personal preferences. 

While it's difficult to determine the exact number, 18 times seems more likely than 27 times. This is because 27 times in a month would imply running the dishwasher almost every day, which might be less common for a single person or a small household. On the other hand, 18 times in a month suggests running the dishwasher approximately every other day, which seems more plausible.

However, please note that this is just a logical inference based on general assumptions, and the actual number of times"

Since Lily is a woman from the US, it is important to consider typical dishwasher usage patterns in the country.

Assuming a 30-day month, it is reasonable to estimate that Lily ran her dishwasher somewhere between 18-27 times.

Since Lily's nephew, Bob, publicly announced the number of times Lily ran her dishwasher, it is more likely that the number is a round figure or an easily memorable number.
